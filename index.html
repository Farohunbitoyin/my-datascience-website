          <h3>Customer Churn Prediction (BCG Virtual Experience)</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            As part of the BCG Data Science & Advanced Analytics Virtual
            Experience, I developed a customer churn prediction framework for
            PowerCo, a major European energy utility.
            <span class="more-text">
              The project focused on analyzing SME customer price sensitivity to
              understand churn drivers and recommend data-driven retention
              strategies. I conducted exploratory data analysis on historical
              customer and pricing data, engineered features to capture signals
              such as price fluctuations, and built a Random Forest model to
              predict churn probabilities. The analysis confirmed that price
              sensitivity was strongly correlated with customer attrition, and
              the predictive model provided a reliable way to identify at-risk
              customers. Based on these insights, I evaluated a 20% discount
              strategy that could effectively retain high-propensity churn
              customers, providing actionable recommendations to minimize
              revenue loss. This project combined technical modeling with
              business framing, translating analytical findings into financial
              impact and practical strategies for decision-making.

          <h3>Ideaspice HR Analytics Project</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            In the Ideaspice HR Analytics Project, I developed a predictive
            framework to identify the key factors influencing employee turnover
            and to recommend actionable retention strategies. Using structured
            employee data, I performed exploratory analysis to uncover
            significant patterns, including the impact of monthly income,
            overtime, distance from home, and age on attrition risk.
            <span class="more-text">
              The analysis also highlighted the influence of line managers, with
              notable turnover occurring shortly after managerial changes. The
              project combined statistical insights with predictive modeling,
              where Logistic Regression and Random Forest were trained,
              optimized, and evaluated using metrics such as ROC AUC and
              confusion matrices. Employees were categorized into low, medium,
              and high-risk groups based on predicted probabilities, forming the
              basis of a structured ‚ÄúRetention Plan.‚Äù Recommendations included
              competitive wage benchmarking, improved workload management,
              targeted manager training, and support for younger employees
              through career development opportunities. These insights
              translated into a data-driven approach that can help HR leaders
              proactively reduce attrition and strengthen workforce stability.

          <h3>Bank Customer Churn Analysis</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            In this Bank Customer Churn Analysis project, I explored a dataset
            of 10,000 customers across three countries to uncover patterns
            behind customer retention and attrition. Exploratory analysis showed
            that 79.6% of customers were retained while 20.4% had churned,
            highlighting a significant challenge for profitability. Numerical
            features such as Age, Balance, and Credit Score were binned and
            analyzed to better capture behavioral differences between retained
            and churned groups.
            <span class="more-text">
              To build predictive capability, I applied Decision Tree and Random
              Forest classifiers, using GridSearchCV and cross-validation for
              model optimization. A critical issue of data leakage was
              identified and resolved, which ensured trustworthy evaluation
              results. The final Random Forest model achieved strong
              generalizability, with 97% recall for retained customers and 47%
              recall for churned customers, supported by insights from feature
              importance analysis. Recommendations included hyperparameter
              tuning, feature engineering, and class imbalance handling
              techniques to further improve churn sensitivity and create a
              deployable pipeline for production.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Impact Statement:</strong>
              Built a churn prediction model for a bank‚Äôs 10,000 customers,
              uncovering key behavioral drivers of attrition and delivering
              actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies.

          <h3>Time Series Forecasting: Daily Minimum Temperatures</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            In this Time Series Forecasting project, I analyzed ten years of
            Australia‚Äôs daily minimum temperature data to build predictive
            models for temperature forecasting. The analysis began with
            exploring the temporal structure of the data, checking for
            stationarity, seasonality, trends, and autocorrelation using
            statistical tests and visualizations. A baseline one-step prediction
            model was established, followed by more advanced approaches
            including Autoregression (AR), ARIMA, and Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
            models.
            <span class="more-text">
              To strengthen the analysis, I also experimented with resampling
              techniques such as downsampling and upsampling to better
              understand long-term patterns. Decomposition methods, both
              additive and multiplicative, were applied to separate trend,
              seasonality, and residual components. Using a dummy dataset of
              U.S. airline monthly aircraft miles flown, I further demonstrated
              techniques such as differencing, persistence modeling, moving
              averages, and walk-forward validation to illustrate model
              robustness.
              <br /><br />
              The final SARIMA model showed strong performance in capturing both
              trend and seasonality, making it well-suited for forecasting daily
              temperature values. Recommendations included hyperparameter tuning
              for ARIMA-family models, extending walk-forward validation for
              more realistic evaluation, and exploring advanced deep learning
              approaches such as LSTMs for future work.

          <h3>YouTube NLP Sentiment Analysis</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            In this YouTube NLP project, I performed sentiment analysis on user
            comments to uncover audience perceptions and engagement patterns.
            Comments were preprocessed by handling missing values and applying
            the TextBlob library to extract polarity and subjectivity scores,
            categorizing each comment into positive, negative, or neutral
            sentiments.
            <span class="more-text">
              To make the insights more actionable, the most positive and most
              negative comments were highlighted with their corresponding
              sentiment scores. The sentiment distribution was visualized
              through bar and pie charts, while WordClouds were generated for
              both positive and negative comments to reveal dominant themes in
              user feedback.
              <br /><br />
              In addition to comment-level analysis, engagement metrics were
              explored by analyzing trending tags, and a regression analysis
              between views and likes provided further insights into content
              performance. This end-to-end workflow combined natural language
              processing with visualization to generate meaningful insights into
              how viewers interact with content on YouTube.
              <br /><br />
              <strong>Impact:</strong> Built an NLP pipeline to classify YouTube
              comments by sentiment, visualize audience feedback, and uncover
              engagement patterns through text and trend analysis.

            weather-related, and categorical influences on rental demand.
            <span class="more-text">
              A Lasso Regression model was implemented, first on raw data and
              later within a pipeline that standardized numerical variables and
              one-hot encoded categorical features for consistency and
              scalability. Model evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ confirmed
              the pipeline‚Äôs effectiveness, resulting in more accurate and
              interpretable predictions. <br /><br />

            The goal of this project was to predict the likelihood of heart
            attacks using patient health records and to derive clinically
            relevant insights. Exploratory data analysis involved visualizing
            categorical and continuous variables, identifying and removing
            outliers, and addressing target imbalance. Statistical insights
            highlighted gender, chest pain, ECG results, and fasting blood sugar
            as critical features influencing heart attack risk.
            <span class="more-text">
              Multiple models were trained and compared, including Logistic
              Regression, Support Vector Classification, Random Forest, XGBoost,
              and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Data preprocessing steps included
              scaling and transformation to ensure optimal model performance.
              While Support Vector Classification produced the highest accuracy,
              simpler models such as Logistic Regression and KNN were preferred
              due to their interpretability and more realistic accuracy range
              (72‚Äì82%). Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV further
              optimized results.
              <br /><br />
              The project provided actionable recommendations, such as targeted
              screening for males, sensitization about chest pain symptoms,
              routine home monitoring of vitals, annual ECG tests for high-risk
